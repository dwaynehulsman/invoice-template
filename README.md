## üöÄ Why This Tool?

I created this invoice creator because I needed a **simple way to write invoices without complicated tooling or having to deal with accounts and subscriptions**. Most invoice tools are either:

- Too complex with unnecessary features
- Require monthly subscriptions
- Force you to create accounts and store data in the cloud
- Have poor user interfaces

This tool is different:

- ‚úÖ **No accounts required** - just open and use
- ‚úÖ **No subscriptions** - completely free
- ‚úÖ **Simple and focused** - does one thing well
- ‚úÖ **Privacy-first** - your data stays on your device
- ‚úÖ **Modern interface** - clean and professional
